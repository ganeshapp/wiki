**Zapps** are tools (not services) that trade convenience for autonomy: they run primarily on the user's device, store state locally in open formats, and don't require an account or a maker-owned server. The opposite of SaaS, in the literal sense.

The label was invented to give the design pattern a name so it can be built deliberately, and to make it easier for AI coding assistants to follow when scaffolding new projects.

Neither model is universally right. Zapps are well-suited to single-user tools and small-group products. They are a poor fit for collaboration-heavy or notification-driven products. The pages below try to be honest about both ends.

## Start here

- [[Zapp Manifesto]] — the philosophy and the autonomy/convenience trade-off it makes.
- [[Zapp Architecture Patterns]] — the concrete engineering techniques (OAuth Device Flow, Napkin URL state, Walkie-Talkie networking, Git-as-Backend, OS-folder sync).
- [[Why Buy Once Software Died]] — historical context for how the old "own it forever" model collapsed and why a modern revival is feasible.

## When the pattern fits — and when it doesn't

- [[When Zapps are Wrong]] — workloads, user populations, and operator situations where the model is a bad choice.
- [[Zapp Anti-Patterns]] — common drift-back-to-SaaS mistakes builders make in good faith.
- [[The Discovery Problem]] — the hardest unsolved problem in the philosophy: how anyone finds a Zapp in the first place.

## Reference

- [[Zapp Data Formats]] — JSON, SQLite, GPX, OPML, iCalendar — the open formats a Zapp ecosystem shares.
- [[Forking Over Modding]] — why public-domain forks beat plugin systems for Zapps.
- [[Public Domain Software Licenses]] — MIT-0 and 0BSD as the legally cleanest "no strings attached" choices.
- [[Zapp Cursor Rules]] — a ready-to-paste `.cursorrules` file for AI-assisted development.

## Inspiration

- [[Local-First Philosophy]] — the closest existing tradition Zapps draws from, with honest differences.
- [[Why the Web Got Walled]] — the economic story of how we got to a platform-dominated web in the first place.
